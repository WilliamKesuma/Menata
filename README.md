# Menata â€“ 3D Tools for Interior Designers
Menata is an iOS app designed to help interior designers create and manage 3D models easily and efficiently. We noticed that designers often spend a lot of time preparing models and struggle to find accurate 3D assets. Menata solves this by combining three powerful Apple technologies into one tool.

ðŸšª RoomPlan
Scan and generate 3D models of real rooms using Appleâ€™s RoomPlan API. It captures room layout, walls, windows, and furniture with accurate dimensions.


ðŸª‘ Object Capture
Turn real-world furniture or decor items into detailed 3D models using your deviceâ€™s camera. Perfect for adding custom items to your design library.

ðŸ›  RealityKit
Combine your room and object scans in a single interactive 3D space. Move, rotate, and arrange models with ease to visualize your design.
